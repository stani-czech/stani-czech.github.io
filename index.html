			<p>This website is ment to showcase my progress in web development and to be used as a practise tool for my other various projects.</p>
			<p>Long term goal is to create a well structured and well designed portfolio website. To improve from static HTML, CSS pages to practical dynamic using JavaScript.</p>
			<p>Another goal is to create my personal cheatsheet for all technologies, scripting or programming languages I am trying to improve in or learn.</p>
			<p>In the end, I would like this page to be a detailed portfolio of my work and skills to be used as a better interpretation of my abilities than a traditional resume.</p>
